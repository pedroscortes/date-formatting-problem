# Date Formatting Problem


It is common in some data projects (especially when we work internationally) to work with tables in which the date is stored as text, and is formatted in the most diverse ways.

Ex: 'yyyy-mm-dd', 'yyyy/mm/dd', 'dd-mm-yyyy', 'mm/dd/yyyy' and some other peculiar formats.

I'm saving this repository because I see that it's not common to find this type of solution on the internet, and it could be useful for me in other projects or for other people!

The queries were written to be used on [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com).

NOTE: This is a paleative solution, the data must be processed at ingestion, and not in the analytical layer
